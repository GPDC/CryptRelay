# Todo:
-Update state machine design so the control flow is better
-encryption
-Fix chat output issue when someone sends you a message while you are typing
-sha hashes to make sure file copy & transfer is legit.
-improve display of file size so that it will show different size when appropriate. I.E. 357.2 MB, 1.2 GB
-remove displaying of errors of closesocket and shutdown in the deconstructor for Connection class
-prevent opening of CryptRelay.exe. Like if someone sends you a file CryptRelay.exe, you will open CryptRelay.exe and start trying to write to it.
-prevent incompatible symbols from being used with files.

# Research:
-I have serious concerns about the fact that messages contain predictable content. Could this be used to reduce brute force decryption time? I don't know much about this area, need research. Could add random amounts of junk data at the beginning and end.

# Think about possibly doing these:
-GetAdapterAddresses() on windows, getifaddrs() on linux, should be implemented so when the user decides to turn off upnp they won't have to type in their local ip addr.
-might want to get the username by (windows)getusername()  and linux  getlogin_r()
-In the FormatCheck.cpp, the port is already changed from string to a number. Change code everywhere to stop taking strings,and to stop changing strings to numbers for ports. Also minor change must be made in FormatCheck to return the port instead of bool.
-implement a progress indicator for the file copy or file transfer. It would preferably be something like this due to using a terminal: in the getuserinput section that does getline(), check to see if the user typed out "progress()", and if the user did, then display the current progress of the file transfer, or file copy, whatever. This would be done by giving a displayProgress() function the args: total_bytes_sent, file_size.  It would just do a simple divide calculation and turn it into a % and display that.  
OR OR could just have getuserinput() set a global variable that be: display_progress = true; , and any function like copyFile() would check if(display_progress == true), then displayProgress(total_bytes_sent, file_size); and inside the displayProgress() it would make sure to set display_progress = false; at the end.
Or because i'm no longer implementing file transfer during chat, just make a cool progress bar. or because i am now, ha, find a fix for the chat output issue and then this won't be a problem to implement.
-select() maybe should be replaced by poll() and WSAPoll() ?
-adding / fixing displayTimeStarted() in the UpnP class

# Critical Errors:


# Non-critical errors:
-localtime_r is erroring (linux).


# Odd behavior:


# Note-worthy side effects of actions:
-ctrl-c doesn't call deconstructors. Therefore it won't automatically delete the port forward that was automatically added at the beginning.
