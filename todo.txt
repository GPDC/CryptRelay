# Todo:
-encryption
-output what IP and port the user is listening on (server)
-allow the user to exit the program by typing:  exit()  or something similiar
-In the FormatCheck.cpp, the port is already changed from string to a number. Change code everywhere to stop taking strings,and to stop changing strings to numbers for ports. Also minor change must be made in FormatCheck to return the port instead of bool.
-Fix chat output issue when someone sends you a message while you are typing
-fixed select() timeout issue, but select() should be replaced by poll() and WSAPoll()
