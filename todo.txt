# Todo:
-encryption
-output what IP and port the user is listening on (server)
-allow the user to exit the program by typing:  exit()  or something similiar
-In the FormatCheck.cpp, the port is already changed from string to a number. Change code everywhere to stop taking strings,and to stop changing strings to numbers for ports. Also minor change must be made in FormatCheck to return the port instead of bool.
-Fix chat output issue when someone sends you a message while you are typing
-fixed select() timeout issue, but select() should be replaced by poll() and WSAPoll()
-file transfer. It should send a message to the peer when the user wants to send a file (during chat session). That sent message would include the size and name of the file and a (Y / N) option. The peer's next message would be the response. If array[0] of the peer's response is Y, then the peer will start another terminal and attempt to create a new session with the user using the -f arg. The user will be doing the same thing. If the connection succeeds, begin sending the file.

# Critical Errors:
if multiple CryptRelay programs are trying to run on the same computer, then only one of them will work. The other will fail 10048 because the address && port is already in use. To solve this, need to check to see if the port that the program is going to use is free or not on the computer. -- check if port is open before doing upnp port forwarding, so the upnp can port forward to the correct port.

# Non-critical errors:
localtime_r is erroring.


# Odd behavior:
