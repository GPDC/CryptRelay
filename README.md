CryptRelay is a command line peer-to-peer encrypted chat and file transfer program for Windows and Linux. Currently a work in progress.

CryptRelay utilizes UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) to automatically port forward so the user doesn't have to.


Crypt relay was programmed in Netbeans IDE 8.1 when using Linux, and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015  when using Windows.
C++14.
