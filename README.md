# CryptRelay
CryptRelay is a command line peer-to-peer encrypted chat and file transfer program for Windows and Linux. Currently a work in progress.

CryptRelay utilizes UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) to port forward so the user doesn't have to do it manually.

Programmed in Eclipse 3.8.1 when using Debian Linux, and to a small extent Netbeans IDE 8.1 was also used when using Debian Linux(I do not recommend using Netbeans on Debian, for C++), and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 when using Windows 7.
Written for C++14.
