CryptRelay is a command line peer-to-peer encrypted chat and file transfer program for Windows and Linux. Currently a work in progress.

CryptRelay utilizes UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) to port forward so the user doesn't have to do it manually.

Programmed in Netbeans IDE 8.1 when using Linux, and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 when using Windows 7.
C++14.
